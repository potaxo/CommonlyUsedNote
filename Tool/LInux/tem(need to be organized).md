✅ **Restating your question for clarity:**
You’re using Linux and ran a Jupyter Notebook process in the terminal. After pressing `Ctrl+Z`, it seems to have been suspended (paused). Now you want to:

1. **Check if it’s really suspended**, and
2. **Shut it down properly**.

That’s a great question for a new Linux user — these are common shell management issues that build your confidence on Linux.

## 🚀 Why `Ctrl+Z` caused this?

* When you press `Ctrl+Z` in a terminal, it sends a `SIGTSTP` signal to the foreground process, **suspending (pausing) it** and putting it into the background in a stopped state.
* It doesn’t terminate it — it’s just waiting.

---

## 🔍 How to check if it’s suspended?

You can use:

```bash
jobs
```

This lists your current shell’s background jobs.

You’ll see something like:

```
[1]+  Stopped                 jupyter notebook
```

---

## 🛑 How to shut it down?

You have a few options.

### ✅ 1. Bring it back to the foreground and then stop it gracefully

```bash
fg %1
```

(assuming it’s job `[1]`).

Then stop it by pressing `Ctrl+C`.

---

### ✅ 2. Kill the background job directly

If you see it as job `[1]`, use:

```bash
kill %1
```

If you want to force kill it (not usually needed for Jupyter, but good to know):

```bash
kill -9 %1
```

---

### ✅ 3. Or find its process and kill by PID

If you’ve already exited the shell or lost the job info, find it by:

```bash
ps aux | grep jupyter
```

and then kill by PID:

```bash
kill <pid>
```

or force kill with `kill -9 <pid>`.

## ⚡ Forward-thinking tip

Learning these basics of Linux process control (`jobs`, `fg`, `bg`, `kill`, `ps`) will be extremely helpful as you go deeper into software engineering, especially when managing servers or debugging long-running scripts.

Also:

* Consider running Jupyter with `nohup` or inside a `tmux` or `screen` session for longer work so it’s immune to terminal disconnections.
* Example:

  ```bash
  nohup jupyter notebook &
  ```

  This keeps it running even if you close the terminal.

---

✅ **Summary command cheat sheet for you:**

```bash
jobs                  # list jobs
fg %1                 # bring job 1 to foreground
kill %1               # kill job 1
ps aux | grep jupyter # find running jupyter processes
kill <pid>            # kill by PID
```
